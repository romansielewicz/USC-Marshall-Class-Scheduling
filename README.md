Class Scheduling Optimization for USC Marshall

The Academic Administration team at USC Marshall School of Business is looking to improve
their current system for scheduling classes. 
The directos of class scheduling mentioned several goals in introducing this problem, and 
we have created an optimization tool with these goals in mind to improve the efficiency 
of course scheduling.
